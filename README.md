# RCPS4-Model-Dumper
WIP Script to rip rcps4 model files

# Usage
simply run `rcps4_model_dumper.py *file*` and the program should output an OBJ file, plus a txt file detailing the joint information that can currently be read.

# Known Issues
Currently doesn't support ripping vertex weights or bone positions. Textures also can't be ripped as of writing this, severely limiting overal usefulness.
